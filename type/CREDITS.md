# Credits

Typeface glyphs used here come from the Chicago, Geneva, and Monaco bitmap
typefaces designed by Susan Kare and released by Apple in 1984. The glyphs
are from bitmap images, *not* from font files.

Chicago, Geneva, and Monaco are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.


## Legal Considerations

Legally, the distinction between typeface and font matters.

As far as I can determine, in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, bitmap
typeface glyphs (shapes of letters) are generally not subject to copyright or
design patent protection as long as the typeface is at least 25 years old.

On the other hand, in the U.S., vector fonts qualify for copyrignt protection
as computer code.
